1."Life expectancy" is the average age at death of the entire live-born population. In the middle of the nineteenth century, life expectancy in North America was 40 years, whereas now it is nearly 80 years. Thus, in those days, people must have been considered old at an age that we now consider the prime of life.

Which of the following, if true, undermines the argument above?

A. In the middle of the nineteenth century, the population of North America was significantly smaller than it is today.<br>
B. Most of the gains in life expectancy in the last 150 years have come from reductions in the number of infants who die in their first year of life.<br>
C. Many of the people who live to an advanced age today do so only because of medical technology that was unknown in the nineteenth century.<br>
D. The proportion of people who die in their seventies is significantly smaller today than is the proportion of people who die in their eighties.<br>
E. More people in the middle of the nineteenth century engaged regularly in vigorous physical activity than do so today.<br>

2.Scientists propose placing seismic stations on the floor of the Pacific Ocean to warn threatened coastal communities on the northwestern coast of the United States of approaching tidal waves caused by earthquakes. Since forewarned communities could take steps to evacuate, many of the injuries and deaths that would otherwise occur could be avoided if the government would implement this proposal.

The answer to which of the following questions would be most important in determining whether implementing the proposal would be likely to achieve the desired result?

A. When was the last time that the coastal communities were threatened by an approaching tidal wave?<br>
B. How far below sea level would the stations be located?<br>
C. Would there be enough time after receiving warning of an approaching tidal wave for communities to evacuate safely?<br>
D. How soon after a tidal wave hits land is it safe for evacuees to return to their communities?<br>
E. Can the stations be equipped to collect and relay information about phenomena other than tidal waves caused by earthquakes?<br>

3.Homeowners aged 40 to 50 are more likely to purchase ice cream and are more likely to purchase it in larger amounts than are members of any other demographic group. The popular belief that teenagers eat more ice cream than adults must, therefore, be false.

The argument is flawed primarily because the author

A. fails to distinguish between purchasing and consuming<br>
B. does not supply information about homeowners in age groups other than 40 to 50<br>
C. depends on popular belief rather than on documented research findings<br>
D. does not specify the precise amount of ice cream purchased by any demographic group<br>
E. discusses ice cream rather than more nutritious and healthful foods<br>

4.According to a prediction of the not-so-distant future published in 1940, electricity would revolutionize agriculture. Electrodes would be inserted into the soil, and the current between them would kill bugs and weeds and make crop plants stronger.

Which of the following, if true, most strongly indicates that the logic of the prediction above is flawed?

A. In order for farmers to avoid electric shock while working in the fi elds, the current could be turned off at such times without diminishing the intended effects.
<br>B. If the proposed plan for using electricity were put into practice, farmers would save on chemicals now being added to the soil.
<br>C. It cannot be taken for granted that the use of electricity is always beneficial.
<br>D. Since weeds are plants, electricity would affect weeds in the same way as it would affect crop plants.
<br>E. Because a planting machine would need to avoid coming into contact with the electrodes, new parts for planting machines would need to be designed.

5.A company is considering changing its policy concerning daily working hours. Currently, this company requires all employees to arrive at work at 8 a.m. The proposed policy would permit each employee to decide when to arrive-from as early as 6 a.m. to as late as 11 a.m.

The adoption of this policy would be most likely to decrease employees’ productivity if the employees’ job functions required them to

A. work without interruption from other employees
<br>B. consult at least once a day with employees from other companies
<br>C. submit their work for a supervisor’s eventual approval
<br>D. interact frequently with each other throughout the entire workday
<br>E. undertake projects that take several days to complete
