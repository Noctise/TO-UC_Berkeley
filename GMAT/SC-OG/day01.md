1. 做介词
    1. 单独用

2. 做连词
    1. 比较结构中表达比较，接句子
    
    According to a recent poll, owning and living in a freestanding house on its own land is still a goal of a majority of young adults，as it was of earlier generations. 

    To meet the rapidly rising market demand for fish and seafood, suppliers are growing fish twice as fast as they grow naturally, cutting their feed allotment by nearly half and raising them on special diets.
    
    （as表达比较有时候会省略，以至于后面只接了一个介词短语的成分。

    2. 相当于 when  while, 当....随着...

表达正如...和...无不同

 as...as结构中 第一个as

4. 做关系代词

as可以做关系代词引导限定或者非限定 定语从句（就像that/which）

He is late, as is often the case.

习惯表达： as is known to all/ as seen from the table/ as is often said /as compared with...（这个经常出现在gmat中）

## 含有比较语义的动词
通常咱们童鞋在看到as和than 才会联想到比较这一章节的知识点，然后去寻找比较对象，接着去判断是否平行。其实在英语当中，还要相当一部分的动词，本身就隐含有比较的意思，比如exceed，outperform，overshadow等等之类的。这个我觉得大家也没有必要把它作为一个单独的语法点去记忆，很多时候结构和语义是密不可分的。如果你说A exceed B， 翻译成中文就是A超过B，如果A都能超过B的话，其实暗含的结构就是A和B需要平行，它们之间要有一定的可比性。这里顺带也提一句，很多同学没有养成分析结构的同时，推敲背后语义的习惯，所以一直在抱怨语法点太多，太碎，记不住，用不上。一旦你尝试理解背后的语义，一旦你学会去判断哪种语义是能够make sense的话，这些语法点和结构的东西已经变得不再重要，这些桥梁性的工具早已可以摒弃，你也不再会吐槽语法点的琐碎了。

回到比较含义的动词，我们拿OG上一道典型的题目作为例子，进一步去理解这个知识点：

Although she was considered among her contemporaries to be the better poet than her husband, later Elizabeth Barrett Browning was overshadowed by his success.

(A) Although she was considered among her contemporaries to be the better poet than her husband, later Elizabeth Barrett Browning was overshadowed by his success.

(B) Although Elizabeth Barrett Browning was considered among her contemporaries as a better poet than her husband she was later overshadowed by his success.

(C) Later overshadowed by the success of her husband, Elizabeth Barrett Browning’ poetry had been considered among her contemporaries to be better than that of her husband.

(D) Although Elizabeth Barrett Browning’s success was later overshadowed by that of her husband among her contemporaries she was considered the better poet.

(E) Elizabeth Barrett Browning’s poetry was considered among her contemporaries as better than her husband, but her success was later overshadowed by his.

 

这一题很多同学刚上手的时候，一脸懵逼，直接从代词的角度去理解，发现也做不太出来。如果这一题抓住了overshadow的前后比较，就简单很多了，比如说A选项，Elizabeth was overshadowed by his success，意思变成伊丽莎白被她丈夫的成功超过，人和成功比较，错误。同理，B排除。C选项，无非是把结构调整了一下，将overshadow没有放在谓语动词的位置，而是放在了句首。过去分词在句首，修饰主语peotry，其语义上还是错误的，变成诗歌被成功超过。E选项，说的是poetry was considered better than her husband，诗歌和husband比较，排除。
