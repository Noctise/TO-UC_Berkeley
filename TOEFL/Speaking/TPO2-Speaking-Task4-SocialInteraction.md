# Social Interaction
People deal with each other every day. This interaction is at the heart of social life. The study of social interaction is concerned with the influence people have over one another s behavior. People take each other into account in their daily behavior and in fact, the very presence of others can affect behavior. For example, one principle of social interaction, audience effects, suggests that individuals’ work is affected by their knowledge that they are visible to others, that the presence of others tends to alter the way people behave or perform an activity.

# Listening
Now listen to part of a talk in a sociology class. The professor is discussing audience effects.
Professor: OK. So we said that the way we interact with others has an impact on our behavior. In fact, there's some interesting research to suggest that in one type of interaction - when we're being observed specifically, when we know we're being watched as we perform some activity - we tend to increase the speed at which we perform that activity.In one study, college students were asked to each put on a pair of shoes – shoes with laces they would have to tic. Now one group of students was told that they would be observed. The second group, however, didn't know they were being observed. The students who were aware that they were being watched actually tied their shoes much faster than the students who thought they were alone. Other studies confirm the same is true even when we're learning new activities.Let's say someone is learning a new (ask - for example, learning how to type. When they’re conscious of being observed, they’ll likely begin typing at a much faster rate than they would if they were alone. But, and this is interesting, the study also showed that certain common behavior- things people typically do, like...making mistakes when you’re learning something new that behavior pattern will also increase. So in other words, when we’re learning to type, and we know we’re being watched, we’ll type faster but we’ll also make more mistakes.

# Question
Explain how the examples of tying shoes and learning to type demonstrate the principle of audience effects.

# Answer
Audience effects suggest that with the knowledge that they're being watched while working, people usually alter their behavior during their work. And the professor illustrates the principle with two studies that suggest this. In the first study, two groups of students were asked to put on shoes that they had to tie, one group being told later that they would be observed, while the other group being kept in dark. So when the researchers began to observe, they found that the group aware of the observation tied faster than the other group. This study shows how audience effects speed up people's action. While the second study suggests that when people are learning new things, with the awareness of being observed, they will not only accelerate, but also increase certain behavior pattern. For instance, when they learn to type, they'll type faster, but meanwhile make more mistakes. (141 words)

人们每天互相打交道。这种互动是社会生活的核心。对社会互动的研究涉及人们对彼此行为的影响。人们在日常行为中考虑到对方，事实上，其他人的存在会影响行为。例如，社会互动的一个原则，即观众效应，表明个人的工作受他们的知识的影响，即他们对他人是可见的，其他人的出现往往会改变人们的行为方式或活动方式。

现在听听社会学课上的部分对话。教授正在讨论观众的影响。
教授：好的。所以我们说，我们与他人交往的方式对我们的行为有影响。事实上，有一些有趣的研究表明，在一种类型的相互作用-当我们被观察到的具体的，当我们知道我们正在看着我们进行一些活动，我们倾向于增加的速度，我们执行的活动。在一项研究中，大学生被要求每穿上一双鞋–系带鞋他们会抽搐。现在有一组学生被告知他们将被观察到。第二组，但是，不知道他们被观察到。那些意识到自己被观察到的学生实际上比他们认为自己孤独的学生更快地系鞋带。其他的研究证实，即使我们正在学习新的活动也是如此。当他们意识到被观察到的时候，他们可能开始打字的速度要比独自一人快得多。但是，有趣的是，这项研究还表明，某些共同的行为——人们通常所做的事情，比如……在学习新事物时犯错误，行为模式也会增加。换句话说，当我们学习打字时，我们知道我们正在被观察，我们打字会更快，但我们也会犯更多的错误。

观众的影响表明，当他们在工作中被观察到的时候，人们通常在工作中改变他们的行为。教授通过两项研究表明了这一原则。在第一项研究中，两组学生被要求穿上他们必须系好的鞋子，一组后来被告知他们将被观察到，而另一组则被关在黑暗中。因此，当研究人员开始观察时，他们发现观察组比其他组更快。这项研究表明观众的影响是如何加速人们的行动的。第二项研究表明，当人们在学习新事物时，随着观察的意识，他们不仅会加速，而且会增加某些行为模式。例如，当他们学会打字时，打字速度会更快，但同时会犯更多的错误。
