# Hot Breakfasts Eliminated
Beginning next month, Dining Services will no longer serve hot breakfast foods at university dining halls. Instead, students will be offered a wide assortment of cold breakfast items in the morning. These cold breakfast foods, such as breads, fruit, and yogurt, are healthier than many of the hot breakfast items that we will stop serving, so health-conscious students should welcome this change. Students will benefit in another way as well, because limiting the breakfast selection to cold food items will save money and allow us to keep our meal plans affordable.

# Listening
Now listen to two students discussing the announcement.
(woman) Do you believe any of this? It's ridiculous.
(man) What do you mean? It is important to eat healthy foods.
(woman) Sure it is! But they are saying a yogurt is better for you than an omelet or than hot cereal? I mean, whether something is hot or cold, that shouldn't be the issue. Let's say maybe on a cold morning, in that case, which is going to be better for you, a bowl of cold cereal or a nice warm omelet? It's obvious. There's no question.
(man) I'm not gonna argue with you there.(woman) And this whole thing about saving money.
(man) What about it?
(woman) Well, they are actually going to make things worse for us, not better. Cause if they start to cutting back and we can't get what we want here on campus, well, we are going to going off campus and pay off-campus prices. And you know what? That'll be expensive. Even if it's only two or three mornings a week, it can add up.

# Question
The woman expresses her opinion of the change that has been announced. State her opinion and explain her reasons for holding that opinion.

# Answer
Well, the woman disagrees with the announcement for two main reasons. For one thing she believes that students will need hot food from time to time. For example on cold mornings students will need hot food like hot cereal more than cold food like yogurt. Secondly she argues that the students will go off-campus to pay more prices to get what they want due to the cutting back of meals. As a result the cost will actually add up and is therefore a worse situation for the students. All in all, the woman disagrees with the announcement for the reasons stated above. (103 words)
