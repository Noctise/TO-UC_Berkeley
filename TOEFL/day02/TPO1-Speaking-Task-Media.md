> Answer

I think television has a positive influence on society. It’s a good source of news. The members in the society can get news easily from News Channels and thus keep themselves informed of what’s happening around. Like, my grandfather watches News on TV everyday just to keep up with the latest events.Beside television can be a kind of entertainment. People can watch different shows on TV such as funny talk shows and soap operas. I have many friends who like watching Late show with David Letterman and some other friends like watching TV series such as Lost and Friends. They all consider TV as a good way of relaxing themselves and of killing time. So, with the news and same TV programs, people in a society share a lot of things that they can talk about in any event. Therefore, society actually benefits from TV.
