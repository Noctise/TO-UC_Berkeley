## TPO1-Listening-Rose-Fratzen
Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a contemporary art class.

Professor: Ok, I’m going to begin this lecture by giving you your next assignment. Remember I said that at some point during this semester I wanted you to attend an exhibit at the Fairy Street Gallery and then write about it? Well, the exhibit that I want you to attend is coming up. It’s already started in fact, but it’ll be at the gallery for the next month, which should give you plenty of time to complete this assignment.
The name of the artist exhibiting there is Rose Frantzen. Frantzen’s work may be unfamiliar to you since she’s a relatively young artist, but she’s got a very unusual style, compared to some of the artists we’ve looked at this term. But anyway, Frantzen’s style is what she herself calls Realistic Impressionism. So you’ve probably studied both of these movements separately, separate movements, Realism and Impressionism, in some of your art history courses. So who can just sum these up?

Student: Well, Impressionism started in the late 19th century. Um…the basic impressionist style was very different from earlier styles. It didn’t depict scenes or models exactly as they looked. Um… Impressionist painters tended to apply paint really thickly, and in big brushstrokes, so the texture of the canvas was rough.

Professor: Good. What else? What were the subjects?

Student: Well, a lot of impressionist artists painted everyday scenes, like people on the streets and in cafes, lots of nature scenes, especially landscapes.

Professor: Good. So when you go to the exhibit, I really want you to take a close look at a certain painting. It’s a farm scene. And you will see it right as you enter the gallery. The reason I think this painting is so important is that it stresses the impressionist aspect of Frantzen’s style. It’s an outdoor scene, an everyday scene. It’s kind of bleak, which you can really see those broad brushstrokes and the blurry lines.
The colors aren’t quite realistic. The sky is kind of, well, an unnatural… pinkish yellow. And the fence in the foreground is blue, but somehow the overall scene gives an impression of a cold, bleak, winter day on a farm. So that’s the impressionist side of her work. Oh, and speaking about farms, that reminds me one interesting thing I read about Franzten is that when she first moved back to Iowa after living abroad, she often visited this place in her town called the Sales Barn.
And the Sales Barn, it was basically this place where the local farmers bought and sold their cattle, their farm animals. And the reason Frantzen went there, and she later on would visit other places like dance halls, was to observe people and the ways that they moved. She really found that this helped her work--that it gave her an understanding of body movements and actions, how humans move, and stand still, what their postures were like, too. So, what about Realism? What are the elements of Realism we should be looking for in Frantzen’s work?

Student: Um… real honest depictions of subject matter, pretty unidealized stuff, and pretty everyday subject matter, too.

Professor: Good. One other painting I really want you to look at is of a young woman surrounded by pumpkins. You will notice that the woman’s face is so realistic looking that it’s almost like a photograph. The woman’s nose is a little less than perfect and her hair is kind of messed up. This is realism.
But then, the background of the painting, this woman with the pumpkins is wrapped in a blanket of broad thick brushstrokes, and, it’s all kinds of zigzagging brushstrokes and lines, kind of chaotic almost when you look at it close. And there are vibrant colors. There’s lots of orange, with little hints of an electric blue peeking out.
I find Frantzen to be a very accessible artist. I mean, some artists, to appreciate them, you have to know their life story. But here’s a little bit about Rose Frantzen’s life anyway. She attended art school, but was told by one of her instructors that she was not good at illustration, that she should go into advertising instead. So she took advertising classes and fine arts classes too, until she was convinced by the head of an advertising agency that her work was really good, that she could be an artist.
But of course, it’s not as easy as that, and so Frantzen had to paint other people’s portraits at places like art fairs just to make money to buy paint for her more series of art work. No matter what, she never stopped painting. And now, Frantzen is doing extremely well. And her work is being shown all over the country. So I think most of us would be discouraged if we had to face challenges and difficulties like that. But what’s important is that you keep at it that you don’t give up. That’s what is really important to remember.

教授：同学们，我将以给各位布置下一次作业的方式来来时今天的课。还记得这学期我说过让你们参加仙女街画廊展出并写观后感的事吗？现在，我说的那个展出马上就要到了。它已经开始了，而那个画廊将在下个月开始，给你们来完成这次作业的时间应该还算充裕的。展出的艺术家的名字是Rose Frantzen。Frantzen的作品对你们来说可能不太熟悉，因为她是一个相对年轻的艺术家，与我们在这个学期里看到的一些艺术家相比，她的风格的确和大家有很大的不同。但无论如何，Frantzen的风格是她自己所称的现实印象派。所以你可能在一些艺术史课程中分别研究了这两种运动，迥异的运动--现实主义和印象主义。那么，谁来对他们做个小结?

学生：嗯，印象主义始于19世纪后期。基本的印象派风格与早期的风格有很大的不同。它并不完全按照实景或模特的形状来描绘。印象派画家倾向于把颜料涂得很厚，并且喜欢用粗笔，所以使用的帆布质地很粗糙。

教授:很好。还有什么?（至于）主题呢?

学生：很多印象派画家都画了日常的场景，比如街上和咖啡馆里的人，很多自然景色，尤其是山水风景。

教授:很好。所以当你去看展览的时候，我真的希望你们仔细看一幅画。这是一个农场的场景。当你进入美术馆时，你会看到它。我认为这幅画如此重要的原因是它强调了Frantzen风格的印象派风格。这是一个户外场景，一个日常场景。这（看上去）有点凄凉，你可以看到那些宽阔的笔触和模糊的线条/看着这些粗大模糊的线条。颜色不太逼真。天空（的颜色）有一些不自然的。。。粉红色的黄色。前景的栅栏是蓝色的，但不知怎的，整个场景给人的印象是一个农场里寒冷、阴冷的冬日。这就是她作品中印象派的一面。哦，谈到农场，这让我想起了一件有趣的事情，我读到Franzten的一件事是，当她在国外生活后第一次搬回爱荷华州时，她经常去她的那个叫“销售谷仓”的地方。
而销售谷仓，基本上就是当地的农民买卖他们的牲畜，他们的农场动物的地方。Frantzen去那里的原因是，她后来去了其他地方，比如舞厅，是为了观察人们和他们的移动方式。她真的发现，这有助于她的工作——这让她了解了身体的动作和动作，人类是如何移动的，以及他们的姿势是怎样的。所以,现实主义呢?在Frantzen的工作中，我们应该寻找的现实主义元素是什么?

学生：嗯……对题材的真实描述，相当的统一化的东西，以及日常的题材。

教授:很好。我想让你们看的另一幅画是一个被南瓜包围的年轻女子。你会注意到，女人的脸看起来很逼真，就像一张照片。这个女人的鼻子有点不完美，她的头发有点乱。这是现实主义。
但是，这幅画的背景是，这个有南瓜的女人被包裹在一层厚厚的一层的笔触中，而且，这是一种非常曲折的笔触和线条，几乎在你看它的时候就会有点混乱。还有鲜艳的颜色。那里有很多桔黄色的东西，几乎没有什么蓝色的迹象。
我发现Frantzen是一个非常平易近人的艺术家。我的意思是，一些艺术家，欣赏他们，你必须了解他们的人生故事。但这里有一点关于Rose Frantzen的生活。她上了艺术学校，但她的一位老师告诉她，她不擅长做插图，她应该去做广告。所以她也上了广告课和美术课，直到她被一家广告公司的主管说服，她的工作真的很好，她可以成为一名艺术家。
当然，这并不是那么容易，所以Frantzen不得不在艺术博览会上画其他人的肖像，只是为了为她的系列艺术作品购买颜料。无论如何，她从未停止绘画。现在，Frantzen做得很好。她的作品正在全国各地展出。所以我想，如果我们不得不面对这样的挑战和困难，我们大多数人都会感到气馁。但重要的是，你要坚持下去，不要放弃。这才是最重要的要记住的。
