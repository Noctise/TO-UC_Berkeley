Today, I'd like to turn our attention to an area of management often overlooked in traditional management courses: small-business management.
今天，我想把咱们的注意力转向一个在传统的管理课程上常常被忽略的管理领域：小型商业管理。

Small businesses have gone from being traditional small-town stores selling food or clothing to sophisticated, high-tech enterprises.
小型商业已经从传统的小镇的商店卖食物或衣服，转到成熟的,高科技企业。

And in addition to the important products they produce, they create jobs for lots of people because there are so many of them.
而且除了他们生产的重要产品之外，他们为很多人创造了就业机会，因为他们（小商业企业）有如此之多。

It's important for management to keep in mind which of the customers' needs the business serves, because it can't serve all their needs.
对管理人员来说重要的是要牢记生意服务的是哪种客户需求，因为它不能服务他们所有的需求。

Writing a business plan that everyone in the organization understands and follows will help to provide the necessary focus and direction.
写一个机构中每个人都能了解并遵循的商业计划，将有助于提供必要的焦点和方向。

It's important to state clearly what the purpose of the business is.
陈述清楚生意的目的是很重要的。

Additionally, each person within the organization must know what tasks to perform in order to fulfill that purpose.
另外，在机构中的每个人都必须知道为了实现该目的要执行什么任务。

Now, if for some reason a business plan doesn't work, try hard to discover why not, rewrite it, and immediately focus on the new plan.
现在，如果因为某种原因商业计划无法运作（不好使），要努力发现为什么不行，重新写，然后立即集中在新的计划上。

A work of caution, however, never give up a bad plan without replacing it.
无论怎样，一个工作的警示，在不能代替它之前永远不要放弃一个不好的计划。

A business has to have a plan because it can't afford to waste its limited resources.
一个生意必须要有一个计划，因为它不能承受它有限的资源的浪费。

And, as you know, waste leads to unnecessarily high production costs.
而且，正如你们所知，浪费导致没必要的高昂的生产成本。

Production costs are at the heart of the company's ability to make a high quality product and sell it at an affordable price.
生产成本是公司制造高品质产品并且在可承受的价格将之出售的能力的核心。
