> ## QUESTION

The administration has plans to acquire a new sculpture for campus. We should all oppose this plan. The university's poor financial condition led it to increase the price for campus housing and tuition by 15% this past year. Surely then it is no financial position to purchase such an expensive sculpture. Moreover, just look at the sculpture: several 60-foot ling steel plates, jutting out of the earth at odd angles! It's so large, it'll take up all the green space in front of the campus center! This is public space that should be reserved for students to use.

> ## ANSWER

Well, the woman disagrees with the reasons and points made in the letter for some reasons. First of all, the woman believes that the money wouldn't be a problem and the assumption in the letter is totally wrong, since an anonymous donor is paying the bill for most of the sculptures instead of the university. And she disagrees with the advice made in the letter because she thinks that the lawn taken for the sculptures will only upset Paul alone instead of other students, simply because Paul has to move to other places of the campus for his ball-playing. In a word, the woman disagrees with the letter for the reasons stated above. (116 words)
