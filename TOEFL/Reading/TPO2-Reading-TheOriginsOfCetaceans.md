It should be obvious that cetaceans—whales, porpoises, and dolphins—are mammals. They breathe through lungs, not through gills, and give birth to live young. Their streamlined bodies, the absence of hind legs, and the presence of a fluke and blowhole cannot disguise their affinities with land dwelling mammals. However, unlike the cases of sea otters and pinnipeds (seals, sea lions, and walruses, whose limbs are functional both on land and at sea), it is not easy to envision what the first whales looked like. Extinct but already fully marine cetaceans are known from the fossil record. How was the gap between a walking mammal and a swimming whale bridged? Missing until recently were fossils clearly intermediate, or transitional, between land mammals and cetaceans.


Very exciting discoveries have finally allowed scientists to reconstruct the most likely origins of cetaceans. In 1979, a team looking for fossils in northern Pakistan found what proved to be the oldest fossil whale. The fossil was officially named Pakicetus in honor of the country where the discovery was made. Pakicetus was found embedded in rocks formed from river deposits that were 52 million years old. The river that formed these deposits was actually not far from an ancient ocean known as the Tethys Sea.

The fossil consists of a complete skull of an archaeocyte, an extinct group of ancestors of modern cetaceans. Although limited to a skull, the Pakicetus fossil provides precious details on the origins of cetaceans. The skull is cetacean-like but its jawbones lack the enlarged space that is filled with fat or oil and used for receiving underwater sound in modern whales. Pakicetus probably detected sound through the ear opening as in land mammals. The skull also lacks a blowhole, another cetacean adaptation for diving. Other features, however, show experts that Pakicetus is a transitional form between a group of extinct flesh-eating mammals, the mesonychids, and cetaceans. It has been suggested that Pakicetus fed on fish in shallow water and was not yet adapted for life in the open ocean. It probably bred and gave birth on land.

Another major discovery was made in Egypt in 1989. Several skeletons of another early whale, Basilosaurus, were found in sediments left by the Tethys Sea and now exposed in the Sahara desert. This whale lived around 40 million years ago, 12 million years after Pakicetus. Many incomplete skeletons were found but they included, for the first time in an archaeocyte, a complete hind leg that features a foot with three tiny toes. Such legs would have been far too small to have supported the 50-foot-long Basilosaurus on land. Basilosaurus was undoubtedly a fully marine whale with possibly nonfunctional, or vestigial, hind legs.

An even more exciting find was reported in 1994, also from Pakistan. The now extinct whale Ambulocetus natans ("the walking whale that swam") lived in the Tethys Sea 49 million years ago. It lived around 3 million years after Pakicetus but 9 million before Basilosaurus. The fossil luckily includes a good portion of the hind legs. The legs were strong and ended in long feet very much like those of a modern pinniped. The legs were certainly functional both on land and at sea. The whale retained a tail and lacked a fluke, the major means of locomotion in modern cetaceans. The structure of the backbone shows, however, that Ambulocetus swam like modern whales by moving the rear portion of its body up and down, even though a fluke was missing. The large hind legs were used for propulsion in water. On land, where it probably bred and gave birth, Ambulocetus may have moved around very much like a modern sea lion. It was undoubtedly a whale that linked life on land with life at sea.

显然，鲸类鲸，海豚和海豚是哺乳动物。他们通过肺呼吸，而不是通过鳃，并生下活的年轻人。他们流线型的身体，没有后腿，以及侥幸和气孔的存在，都无法掩盖他们与居住在哺乳动物中的亲缘关系。然而，与海獭和鳍（海豹，海狮和海象，它们的四肢在陆地和海上起作用）的情况不同，想象出第一批鲸鱼的样子并不容易。已经从化石记录中知道已经灭绝但已经完全海洋的鲸类动物。行走的哺乳动物和游泳鲸鱼之间的差距是如何弥合的？直到最近，还没有发现化石在陆地哺乳动物和鲸目动物之间明显中间或过渡。


非常令人兴奋的发现终于让科学家们重建了鲸类动物最可能的起源。 1979年，一支在巴基斯坦北部寻找化石的团队发现了最古老的化石鲸鱼。该化石被正式命名为Pakicetus以纪念发现的国家。 Pakicetus被发现嵌入在5200万年前河流沉积物形成的岩石中。形成这些矿床的河流实际上离特提斯海这个古老的海洋不远。

化石由一个完整的古细胞颅骨组成，现代鲸目动物的祖先已经灭绝。尽管仅限于头骨，但Pakicetus化石提供了关于鲸类动物起源的宝贵细节。头骨像鲸类似的，但它的下颚缺乏充满脂肪或油的扩大空间，并用于接收现代鲸鱼的水下声音。 Pakicetus可能会像在陆地哺乳动物中那样通过耳孔检测到声音。头骨也没有一个气孔，另一个鲸鱼适应潜水。然而，其他特征表明，专家认为帕克西图特是一群灭绝的肉食哺乳动物，mesonychids和鲸目动物之间的过渡形式。有人认为，Pakicetus在浅水中喂食鱼类，但尚未适应公海的生活。它可能是在陆地上繁殖生下的。

另一个重要发现是1989年在埃及发现的。在特提斯海留下的沉积物中发现了另一头早期鲸鱼的若干骨骼，它们现在在撒哈拉沙漠中露出。这条鲸鱼大约在4000万年前，也就是在Pakicetus之后1200万年前。发现了许多不完整的骨骼，但它们首次在古细胞中包括一条完整的后腿，其特征是脚有三个小脚趾。这样的腿本来就太小了，不足以支撑陆地上50英尺长的罗勒龙。 Basilosaurus毫无疑问是一只完全海洋鲸，可能是无功能的，或者是退化的后腿。

据报道，1994年还有一个更令人兴奋的发现，也是来自巴基斯坦。 4900万年前，现在已经灭绝的鲸鱼Ambulocetus natans（“游泳的行走鲸鱼”）生活在特提斯海。它在Pakicetus之后约300万年，但在Basilosaurus之前有900万年。化石幸运地包括了后腿的一大部分。腿很结实，长得很像现代的鳍。腿部在陆地和海上当然都是有用的。鲸鱼保留了尾巴，缺乏侥幸，这是现代鲸类动物的主要运动方式。然而骨干的结构表明，Ambulocetus通过将身体后部上下移动即使失去了吸吮力，也能像现代鲸鱼一样游走。大后腿用于在水中推进。在土地上，它可能孕育和生下的地方，Ambulocetus可能已经非常像现代海狮一样移动。毫无疑问，这是一条将陆上生活与海上生活联系在一起的鲸鱼。
