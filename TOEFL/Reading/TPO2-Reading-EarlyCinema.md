# TPO2-Reading-EarlyCinema
The cinema did not emerge as a form of mass consumption until its technology evolved from the initial "peepshow" format to the point where images were projected on a screen in a darkened theater. In the peepshow format, a film was viewed through a small opening in a machine that was created for that purpose. Thomas Edison's peepshow device, the Kinetoscope, was introduced to the public in 1894. It was designed for use in Kinetoscope parlors, or arcades, which contained only a few individual machines and permitted only one customer to view a short, 50-foot film at any one time. The first Kinetoscope parlors contained five machines. For the price of 25 cents (or 5 cents per machine), customers moved from machine to machine to watch five different films (or, in the case of famous prizefights, successive rounds of a single fight).

These Kinetoscope arcades were modeled on phonograph parlors, which had proven successful for Edison several years earlier. In the phonograph parlors, customers listened to recordings through individual ear tubes, moving from one machine to the next to hear different recorded speeches or pieces of music. The Kinetoscope parlors functioned in a similar way. Edison was more interested in the sale of Kinetoscopes (for roughly $1,000 apiece) to these parlors than in the films that would be run in them (which cost approximately $10 to $15 each). He refused to develop projection technology, reasoning that if he made and sold projectors, then exhibitors would purchase only one machine-a projector-from him instead of several.

Exhibitors, however, wanted to maximize their profits, which they could do more readily by projecting a handful of films to hundreds of customers at a time (rather than one at a time) and by charging 25 to 50 cents admission. About a year after the opening of the first Kinetoscope parlor in 1894, showmen such as Louis and Auguste Lumiere, Thomas Armat and Charles Francis Jenkins, and Orville and Woodville Latham (with the assistance of Edison's former assistant, William Dickson) perfected projection devices. These early projection devices were used in vaudeville theaters, legitimate theaters, local town halls, makeshift storefront theaters, fairgrounds, and amusement parks to show films to a mass audience. 

With the advent of projection in 1895-1896, motion pictures became the ultimate form of mass consumption. Previously, large audiences had viewed spectacles at the theater, where vaudeville, popular dramas, musical and minstrel shows, classical plays, lectures, and slide-and-lantern shows had been presented to several hundred spectators at a time. But the movies differed significantly from these other forms of entertainment, which depended on either live performance or (in the case of the slide-and-lantern shows) the active involvement of a master of ceremonies who assembled the final program.

Although early exhibitors regularly accompanied movies with live acts, the substance of the movies themselves is mass-produced, prerecorded material that can easily be reproduced by theaters with little or no active participation by the exhibitor. Even though early exhibitors shaped their film programs by mixing films and other entertainments together in whichever way they thought would be most attractive to audiences or by accompanying them with lectures, their creative control remained limited. What audiences came to see was the technological marvel of the movies; the lifelike reproduction of the commonplace motion of trains, of waves striking the shore, and of people walking in the street; and the magic made possible by trick photography and the manipulation of the camera.

With the advent of projection, the viewer's relationship with the image was no longer private, as it had been with earlier peepshow devices such as the Kinetoscope and the Mutoscope, which was a similar machine that reproduced motion by means of successive images on individual photographic cards instead of on strips of celluloid. It suddenly became public—an experience that the viewer shared with dozens, scores, and even hundreds of others. At the same time, the image that the spectator looked at expanded from the minuscule peepshow dimensions of 1 or 2 inches (in height) to the life-size proportions of 6 or 9 feet.

电影院才作为一种大众消费直到它的技术从最初的“西洋镜”格式的图像投射到屏幕上在黑暗的剧院。在西洋镜格式，电影是通过一个机器一个小开口看。Thomas Edison的西洋镜装置，Kinetoscope，在1894被介绍给公众。它被设计用于在Kinetoscope店或商场，其中只有少数个别机器，只允许一个客户查看一个简短的、50英尺的电影在任何时间。第一个活动电影放映机店有五台机器。25美分的价格（或每机5美分），客户从机器到机器的看五部不同的电影（或者，在著名的职业拳击赛，一个战斗回合的情况）。

这些电影放映厅是仿照留声机，这也证明了爱迪生前几年的成功。在留声机里，顾客通过单个的耳朵管听录音，从一台机器移动到另一台机器，听不同的录音讲话或音乐片段。Kinetoscope厅的功能是一样的。爱迪生在kinetoscopes买卖更感兴趣（大约1000美元）这些店比在电影将在其中运行（它的成本约10美元到15美元）。他拒绝发展投影技术，因为如果他制造和销售投影机，参展商只会买一台投影机而不是几。

然而，参展商希望最大限度地提高他们的利润，他们可以更容易地通过向一个时间（而不是一次）将几百部电影投射到数百个顾客身上，收取25到50美分的入场费。在1894的第一个活动电影放映机客厅开放后大约一年，摄影师如路易斯、Auguste Lumiere、托马斯·阿马特、Charles Francis Jenkins、奥维尔和Woodville Latham（爱迪生的前助理，William Dickson协助完善投影设备）。这些早期的投影设备用在杂耍剧院、合法剧院，当地的市政厅，临时店面的剧院，露天游乐场和游乐场为大众观众播放电影。

随着1895-1896投影的出现，电影成为了大众消费的最终形式。以前，大量的观众在剧院观看表演，杂耍表演，流行戏剧、音乐剧、歌唱表演，经典戏剧，演讲，幻灯片显示已提交给数百观众在一个时间。但是电影与其他形式的娱乐有很大的不同，这取决于现场表演（或幻灯片和幻灯表演），由主持最终节目的司仪积极参与。

虽然早期的参展商经常伴随着现场演出的电影，电影的实质是大规模生产的，预先录制的材料，可以很容易地通过与很少或没有由参展商积极参与剧院转载。尽管早期的电影公司将电影和其他娱乐活动结合在一起，以他们认为对观众最具吸引力的方式或是陪他们讲课，但他们的创意控制仍然有限。观众们所看到的是电影的技术奇迹，栩栩如生的再现火车的寻常动作，海浪拍打海岸，以及在街上行走的人们；魔术摄影和操纵相机的魔力使之成为可能。

随着投影的出现，观众与影像的关系不再是私人的，因为它已与早期的西洋镜设备如电影放映机和电影放映机，这是一个类似的机器，再现运动的个人摄影卡连续图像的手段，而不是在电影胶片。它突然成为公众的一种体验，观众与几十，几十，甚至数百人分享。同时，观众看着从1或2英寸西洋镜的尺寸扩大的图像（高）到6或9英尺的真人大小的比例。
